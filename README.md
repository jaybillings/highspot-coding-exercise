# Highspot Coding Exercise - *Elder Scrolls Legends Card Browser*

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It requires Node to run.

# To view the app:
In the project directory run:
* `npm install` to install required dependencies.
* `npm run bild` to build a production-ready app.
* `serve -s build` to serve the new build.

Once this is done, visit the link copied to your clipboard (or one of the two shown in the terminal) to view the app.

Enjoy! :)
